These are wrapper scripts for Gamma, a powerful SAR processing tool. 
Gamma itself is a commercial tool, so you'll have to refer to their install instructions, etc to get up and running.

This code just calls the functions you would normally type by hand or whatever.
Therefore this code is open source and GPL, etc.

I tried to add some intelligence so we can automate some commonly performed tasks.

Depends on:
	- mapready from asf.alaska.edu
	- python 2.6
	- gamma v20090122

Installation Instructions:
	- just dump into you ~/bin directory
	- ensure ~/bin is in your PATH env variable
	- ensure they're executable
